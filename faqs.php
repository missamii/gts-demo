              What is the difference between digital phones and IP phones?

              Digital phones and IP phones have all the same features and functions, except there is one main difference. Digital phones are directly connected to the phone system, IP phones are remotely connected to the phone system. The perfect way to explain this is, that everybody that's in the office will be using the digital phones, and remote or traveling workers will be using an IP phone. For the outside caller, the calls are exactly the same, they will not know if the call is being answered by an digital phone in the office, or by an IP phone from a remote employee.
